HOW does MRP-run able to pick-up which PR document type to use for PR creation? Scanning through the website on SDN, I notice most experts out there recommend using MRP Group with transaction code OPPZ, OPPR, OMDT, OMDV, etc. which are all related to MRP group. However, there are situation in which MRP group is not being use for certain company already in place in their production system. Hence, beside all those OXXX transaction code for the MRP group,where to find out this WHEN MRP GROUP NOT USE (i.e. NOT IN PLACE in material master, and yet, the SAP still able to figure out which PR doc type to use after MRP-run). where to find out this WHEN MRP GROUP NOT USE (i.e. NOT IN PLACE in material master, and yet, the SAP still able to figure out which PR doc type to use after MRP-run).
