Time evaluation determines planned working times and overtime, manages time accounts (flextime balances, overtime, productive hours, and so on), creates wage types (for overtime or bonus wage types, for example), updates time quotas, and checks working time provisions (such as core time violations). The time wage types created during time evaluation are valuated in Payroll. Time evaluation is carried out by a time evaluation driver called RPTIME00. The steps to be carried out by RPTIME00 are specified in a personnel calculation schema. Regards, Waqas Rashid"

There is nothing in the code that does anything with the Batches, but somehow SAP knows which batches to work with. I haven't been able to find any info about it.

Let me explain my requirement with an example: Our business wants to sell in case quantities. Eg : A case contains 6 Jars of 1 kg each. If a customer places order for 10 Jars where case contains 6 jars, 6 jars price will be normal. But the additional 4 jars(which are not in case) will be upcharged by 10%. Similarly if customer places an order for only 5 jars(where case contains 6 jars) all the 5 jars should be upcharged by 10%. The crucial part in this scenario is the list of materials is not in fixed number and they require changes in future. The upcharge is in percentage and it should be on both under and over the case quantity. There are different materials like jars, bottles,tubes etc. and different sizes( 1kg jars,2kg jars, 3 kg jars) It is not a case of pallet surcharge.Please help me. Thanks&Regards, Chandu",

Issue raised as there are few wrong invoice being posted to some wrong vendor and following by payment happened in prior year. somehow business noticed the payment happened to wrong vendor and they posted the credit memo just, to make knock off the Accounts,which is incorrect process. Either they would have reversed the invoice before payment or they would not have posted credit memo after payment, which causing the issue. For instance: 1. Invoice posted ( period April 2012/2013/2014)- there 4 invoice GRIR Ac Dr-1000 Vendor X Cr-1000 2. Payment processed(check payment) Vendor X Ac DR-1000 Bank Ac Cr-1000 After the wrong payment, check processed as void and reconciled at bank level. 3.Again Credit memo posted-Now Business realized the vendor is wrongly posted, it needs reverse, so they posted in 2015. Vendor X Dr 1000 GRIR Ac Cr 1000 4. Now through F.13 GRIR is cleared (automatic monthly batch job picked the GRIR ac). clearing document holds many other Fi doc(approx 2000), including this. so here Vendor is Open GRIR line item is cleared So now requiremnt is to reverse the credit memo and invoice as well in SAP end. we thought of FBRA, to clearing doc, but not possible as it is clearing doc for 2000 docs approx. So anybody has any thought on this, please advise asap, as this is one of the critical item to be addressed asap.",

Is there any possibility in SAP to rewrite the text for the new place. To make you understand clearly here is the example: Example: Existing personnel area: BA12: ABC Pvt. Ltd., Gandhinagar, Delhi. This location is existed from 01.01.2003 till 30.04.2015 The whole entity ABC Pvt. Ltd., Gandhinagar, Delhi is shifted to ABC Pvt. Ltd., MG Road, Delhi. The client want both the records in SAP. 01.01.2003 till 30.04.2015 ABC Pvt. Ltd., Gandhinagar, Delhi. 01.05.2015 till 31.12.9999 ABC Pvt. Ltd., MG Road, Delhi. Is there any possibility to delimit the old record and rename the personnel area? (or) Creating a personnel area is the only solution. Please suggest if any option available.
