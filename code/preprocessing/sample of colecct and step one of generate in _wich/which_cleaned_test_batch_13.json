I have been asked to change some dates for certain calendars but want to be sure that they are not used in other none related shipping points. Obviously this will cause issues! I know some do. Currently Iu2019m stuck manually checking the shipping points individually in SPRO via >Enterprise Structure > Definition > Logistics Execution > Define etc shipping point > Define shipping point. Highlight the row and display. When I try and view any of the tables direct in SE16N (i.e. V_TVST) instead of coming up with nice neat tables I again get the SPRO data inthe above fromat and have to run through manually. Can you help?",

Freight Clearing Account These Accounts get credited when we do goods receipt with TCode MIGO. When we do invoice verification then above two accounts get debited. Hence the balance should be zero for both the above GL accounts. Same way with CENVAT Clearing GL Account. When I do part 2 posting in J1IEX, CENVAT Clearing Account gets credited. When I do MIRO, it gets debited. Hence for CENVAT Clearing Account also, balance should be zero. But in my case, there is credit balances in all the three above GL accounts. Now I want to know for which GRNs, we have not received the invoices because of which balance is there in above three GL accounts. Note: I kept sort key as '010' in GL master for all the above three clearing accounts. But PO number is getting populated in assignment field only for GR / IR Clearing Account (and not Frieght Clearing and CENVAT Clearing GL Account). I just want to know list of GRNs for which invoices are pending. I do not want to post any clearing entry. I tried with F.13, its running only for GR/IR Clearing Account. Its not running for Freight Clearing and CENVAT Clearing Account. (Reason might be that PO number is not getting populated in Assignment field).

Which application(Per_Address_US or Per_Address_US_13) should be deployed? 2. Why is there two applications and two Vc components in one DC? 3. Is there any significance to number 13 wrt ESS 603?

The system creates relations between the requisition (NB) and the positions (S) and stores them in HRP1001. They can be accessed throug the standard HR function modules or throug the e-recruiting classes e.g. CL_HRRCF_OI_BL. The Organizational unit (O) and the Job (C) also read from the relations in table HRP1001. If you only assign an organizational unit and job by filling the second subtab of the container sequence item. e-recruiting stores the Ids of the 2 objects in HRP5125 or HRP5126 (currently have no system to look for it). Names / Texts for all these objects are stored like for all OM objects in HRP1000 and can also be accessed via the e-recruiting classes or through the OM function modules. Hope that answers your question. Best regards Roman Weise"

PO is raised for 15 units of Material Z 5. The reservation created in step 1 is deleted In this scenario, we will have excess of 10 units. How can we trace back to the reservation that caused this excess stock? We've checked the RESB tables but there are no traces of the reservation back to the PR or PO. Also, reservation change logs are not stored in SAP. How can we trace this? Thanks.",
