Due to some performance testing requirements we need to check which user accessed which report and if he has drilled down to a particular level in a report, then there should be a means to know that as well. BO offers a few standard activity reports to check which user has done which activity. However the details of drill down etc. cannot be checked using that. Please help as to how can we check that too. Best Regards, Neha",

Because SAP does not allow you to configure custom TTYs under tcode AO83 for repayment of invest. supprt. and J01/J02 uses TTy group 52 \"Extraord. write-off invest supprt\" which gets classified as unplanned depreciation under Area 41 instead of reducing the Investment support posted under same area 41. Is this the correct way of repaying/refunding? If not, what TTY to use to refund or repay the support (either partially or fully) and if there is any way to customize TTY specially for repaying/refunding this support. Open for any suggestions.

I am trying to find solution in SAP which which enables most basic Sales planning where I am able to make entries for target sales quantity, target sales total amount, etc. on monthly basis, on material and plant level. After some research I found that for this purpose it is best to use: #option 1 - APO (as part of SCM), #option 2 - APO Add-in for SAP ERP (ECC) or #option 3 - stick to core functionalities of SAP ERP (ECC). Since there is very little chance my company will decide for options 1 or 2, our goal is to make best of option 3! Closest I have found is this link bloghttps://blogs.sap.com/2015/08/13/sales-operations-planning/under section STANDARD SOP for Material. https://blogs.sap.com/2015/08/13/sales-operations-planning/ It seems that Sales plan is under PP module.

When there is a sale order, with an increase in the schedule qty, it gets adjusted in the next plaaning. Decrease in the sale order qty causes an increase in the plant stock whereby you can adjust in the production of the next period.
