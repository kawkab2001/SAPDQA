In your experience which of the integration option is better suited from a successfactors view point- Files or webservices(Using SF API)? SAP provides standard integration content for both file based integration as well as SFAPI based integration. However on the successfactors side are there any huge limitations and/or advantages of one over the other? PS: I'm aware of the technical dependencies and the limitations that come with both these options. Also we use SAP PI as our middleware, so personally my preference is to use webservices/SF API for this scenario, however I would like evaluate options from a functional person's/successfactors viewpoint.

As far as i remember php is flexible (instead of other programming languages) and with your syntax returns you the element 0 of the array. So, you have to use a loop (while statement) and at the beggining of each loop you have to \"declare\" wich line are you going to read/write with the SetCurrentLine method. A sample of this command in c# is... oOrder.Lines.SetCurrentLine(iDocRow); Good luck!!! Evanggelos D. Plagianos"

And then some action is done at second custom BO and create these data to \"Supplier invoice\" as \"Supplier invoice\" records.

Why is this behaviour and how can I prevent removal of UDFs which are in use for all users whether authorized or not!

Which i need to update in the material master also. Since generally we run Cost estimate periodically, but if the same is required daily by the client. what is the process to do it. Whether Reference And Simulation costing helps me here? or whether Adhoc cost estimate is the best option. I am new to CO so How they can be configured? i have seen the adhoc cost estimate option but form which transaction can we execute it, because if you choose CK11n in costing variant option, costing variant PADH - Adhoc cost estimate is not seen. Is it also possible whether to run the costing run to analyse and the same cannot be update in my material master? Request you to send me any appropriate solution for my query. regards, Sandeep",

If you Inventory has to be adjusted it is quite obvious it will create a JE towards the Gain/Loss account. You can change this and post to a different GL but the posting cannot be avoided. You need to understand that if the inventory which is not suppose to be there is found and counted - it means at some point the Inventory account was debited and either the Gain/Loss or AP account was credited. So tracking back can give you the details of which account you could post to so that the NET effect is nullified Suda"

When it is run, i get the following resultreport-results.jpg. As you van see in the lowest part of the screen, i see that i have 2 pieces of consumption, which is also validated if i display the CKM3N screen for this material in this period.ckm3n.jpg. My issue is that in the accelerator settings (transaction HDBC) it is set up that for all ML reports the FCML_XXXX tables should be used.hdbc.jpg. But, there is no entry for this material ad that posting period in table FCML_REP (FCML_FILL has not been executed for that period and that plant). Therefore, i understand that the report reads either the ML tables directly, or there is another source of supply. When i check the report, i see the followingabap.jpg. It shows like i have created the report yesterday (which i did not - it is a standard SAP report) and that it reads data from KKBML table. When i used FCML_FILL transaction trying to update the FCML tables for this material in these tablesfcml-fill.jpg, then an entry is created in FCML_FILL tablefcml-rep.jpg, but i get 10 information messagesinfo-messages.jpgand 1 warning messagewarning-message.jpg. So, i am confused on what is happening. It seems that the 01MLREPORT reads ML tables although it should read the FCML_XXXX ones. Is it because of this \"No connection to HANA database\" message? How should it be corrected? and, if corrected, how can i change the report so it reads for these tables instead of the ML ones? kkml0.jpg selection-screen.jpg report-results.jpg ckm3n.jpg hdbc.jpg abap.jpg fcml-fill.jpg fcml-rep.jpg info-messages.jpg warning-message.jpg Best personal regards and many thanks, Nikos",
