I have the software for my scanner to scan the paper. What software else do I need in order to get through the capture process (say the program things will be scanned, the barcode is read, I am asked by the software for the document type ... ) I already found postings likebut this is working with local file and afterwards loading the file into the dms.

This is feasible ony for uploading and for this you need to give path of the original files which are saved on some system. Now, your requirement is to scan the documents automatically by some software is not possible at any way. You need to keep the original file as ready for uploading at some location for uploading. Once you store files ,it's easy to upload separately or in batch also. But for scanning there is no possible way. I hoep this will resolve the query. Regards, Ravindra"

The most of these processes are documented in different SAP consulting and FAQ notes. And unfortunately it is impossible to give you a list of SD functionalities, which are not supported by the standard system. Only to show (as an example), here are some functionalities which are not supported in the scheduling agreements: 1) assembly order processing is not supported in the scheduling agreements; 2) third-party pprocessing is not supported in the scheduling agreement (if you have Automotive system, then you can puchase additionally third-party solution for scheduling agrement as Autonmotive consulting solution, z-programs); 3) BOM explosion is not supported in scheduling agreements; 4) variant configuration is not supported in scheduling agreements; 5) product selection is not supported in the scheduling agreements; 6) rule-based availability check is not supported in the scheduling agreements; 7) free goods are not supported in the scheduling agreements; \ud83d\ude0eduring delivery-related billing it is not possible to use prices from the scheduling agreements (they are taken only from condition master); \ud83d\ude0e 9) it is not possible to transfer two items in one DELINS-IDOC (two delivery schedules via one IDOC); 10) it is not possible to create more than one item for external agent delivery to the scheduling agreement via IDOc (ED-order); 11) it is not supported to use the fiscal year change scheme 'C' for scheduling agreements with external agent service; 12) the ATP-allocation functionality is not supported in scheduling agreements, if you have JIT schedules; 13) it is not possible product (or generally, alternative) units of measure in the scheduling agreements; 14) rounding functionality is not supported in the scheduling agreements ........ I hope, this example is sufficient to show, how many processes exist in the ERP system and how many combination of processes are not supported. That was only an example: some not-supported functionalities for scheduling agreements. I hope, this info gives you a general imagination about supported and non-supported processes in ERP-SD, and why it is not possible to describe all not-supported processesn in one response. Nevertheless I hope, that this info helps you for a general imagination. Kind regards, Akmal Vakhidov Development Support SD, SAP, Walldorf/Germany"

It is the reporting country. We have the plants abroad scenario and in this way we have to handle with the reporting country. The point I don't get is the following. I create the vendor invoice for a couple of vendors and everything is fine. The tax codes are in the header and in the line items. But there is one vendor from the same company code and the same country like the other vendors .... but in this case the reporting country is not empty (like it is with the other vendors) ... the reporting country is set to 'DE'. Which is the company code country and the vendors country also. When this is the case the tax codes cannot be filled by the BAPI (and also not within the FV60). Can someone please explain what the reporting country is depending from? When is it switched automatically? Where can I find good documentation about it? So far I have only read that the reporting country is the company codes country... Most of the discussions I found in the SCN regarding this topic are not answered. There are no helpful SSO-Notes. Debugging doesn't led to the required knowlege. Comparing the vendor with reporting country DE and other vendors didn't show differences that helped to understand the setting of the field.

Some of them won't show them, like the total column does not....but that is linetotal in the table. shift Another source of info is the \"REFDB\" help file that is intsalled in your sdk directory. There it will show all the columns and extra info. Hope this helps"

Now I have startet a SAP MM course at a external training center in Germany, bonn. So its not a course at sap original but at least I will make the same Exam with the user certification. How I said in the first question, Firstly I make a SAP MM user certi. The certification name is: C_UCMM_15 . After that I will make a SAP MM Procurement Consulting course. In that course there is a ABAP Modul in Foundation lvl. Consulting Certi Names: C_TS410_1610 SAP Certified Application Associate - Business Process Integration with SAP S/4HANA C_TSCM52_67 SAP Certified Application Associate - Procurement with SAP ERP 6.0 EhP7 So I make all these courses because I want to become a SAP Consulting but in the programming language abap and all the new technologies. Is my learning path well for my goal? I thought, that I do firstly the User Certi, then make the Consulting Certi in MM. After this 2 certi I want reply to Jobs SAP ABAP or other backend Jobs. Because I have then a good Knowledge with the SAP System and learn then the background technologies. Is my learning path right? Should I go another path? Or should I make only a ABAP training like the certification: C_TAW12_750 SAP Certified Development Associate - ABAP with SAP NetWeaver 7.50",
