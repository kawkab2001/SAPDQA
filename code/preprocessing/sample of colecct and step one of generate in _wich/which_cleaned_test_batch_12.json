Both fields can be used independently of each other. say you can used to input short name of the vendor (testing) for easy search and second field you can input category e.g- utilities etc. to identified that vendor which you have define in search help. basically search term is used in search help goto FBL1n and in vendor# field click F4 (select vendor search using address attribute) in search term 2 put utilities it will give list of all vendor having utilities mentioned in search term 2. but if you input testing & utilities it will search for both these citeria. please refer search help for more details (http://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw04/helpdata/en/97/24a23fa34ffb47e10000000a114084/content.htm) hope this helps Please assign points as way to say thanks Message was edited by: Ravi Rana"

I'm working with SAP B1, v9 PL11 on SQL 2008R2. I have to create a query which displays; cardcode, cardname, createdate, cardtype, username of creating user, on or after a date variable. Having looked over the OCRD table I can't see a specific field containing data that would correspond to a user code. OUSR looks like a good candidate with the user details but I don't think I can see any data types which are directly comparable so not able to make a workable join.. I've tried a number of combinations, such as ocrd.usersign = ousr.usersign and while it returned data it was not correct. Please can someone help me find the name of the relevant field, or table which would contain this value so I can then complete my query. Many thanks in advance!",

Better way is to Migrate your hardware/server , start preparation , initialization,extraction everything on new server only . After migration, how you will verify that all pre-requisites are still matched. So better to move safe! Regards, Gagan Deep Kaushal"
