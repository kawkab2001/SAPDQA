If you want to do so It will be the big change for the product costing, sales cycle, inventory transfer and many more process. Also consider following points 1. MTO process is customer requirement driven so it follows PULL methodology is Supply chain. It is only adopted where in end product is slowing moving and company don't want to make inventory with of sales order. 2. MTO is not recommended for the higher production rate and line based production as mentioned in you case. 3. REM is good for rate/schedule based production. Please share feedback on same.

I am trying to build a view that shows the result of cycle counts and how much they are off by the inventory in the system, how often the counts are off, etc. I think I have found the cycle count data in the IKPF and ISEG tables, field ISEG.MENGE has the difference in quantity from the count. What I am looking for is what the system inventory number was at the time of the count. Which tables should I use for that where I can tie it back to the time of that Cycle Count? Would LINK and LINP tables hold these system inventory numbers? And if so, how do I join them to IKPF and ISEG? Or, should I be using MSEG? I see that there is a direct link between ISEG and MSEG, but I don't know which fields in MSEG would hold the System Inventory numbers at the time of count. Any thoughts?",

When we put a reason of rejection in the sales order item of 100 quantity, what exactly will happen? How the system will know it only has to reject the 40 non delivered pieces and not the 100 pieces mentionned in the line item ?

(2). if the customer is not asking any excise invoice then we will send the goods thru depo/storage location which is not registered under excise. if the goods came by road then it will be delivered by road only. if the goods came by rail then it will be delivered by rail only. my logic here is basing on the storage location, transportation types, and distance i want to create condition record that captures exact frieght at the sales order level. confirm whether i am right or wrong. regards, balaji.t 09990019711.",
