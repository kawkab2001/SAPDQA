I suggest you to create a custom program / t-code which will copy and store all the notifications triggered from SAP. The t-code should have resend button and check box. If user receive any inquiry from vendor or realizes that this has not been sent to the vendor, user can go the t-code, select the particular notification and click on 're-send'. These notifications can be saved for few weeks. and later on automatically deleted. -Vedavatee."

Once found, try to find the respective tags in PAPI request to check if it is populated properly. Please consult Javadocs for your ME release - it is available at SMP.

For these requirements, the Material Requirements Planning run first generates planned orders for the finished product, which <b>cannot be converted</b> into a production order (in SAP R/3: <b>Planned orders without a conversion indicator and the order type \u201eVP\u201c</b>and in SAP APO: Planned orders without conversion indicator). You can only convert these planned orders into production orders once the sales order has been received. This then triggers final assembly.

This will explode the BOM components and you can start procuring the items when in advance of sale order receipt. Now once you get sales order (say 25 To) in the system, system will create a planned order of normal type for 25 to and reduce the qty from VP type (from 100 to 75) so that BOM component qty is still maintianed at the same level of 100 TO Hence original qty of VP orders = New planned orders qty + lefet over VP order qty 100 = 25 + 75 please come backI"

The external vendor is linked to the ordering address vendor using partner functions but the OA vendor does not have a link to the other vendor (ie payee) I've two questions: is this setup correct or do we also need to link the OA vendor to the main payee vendor ii) when raising the PO which vendor should be specified? the main vendor to whom payment will be made so that at time of invoice verification , relevant account can be automatically determined & then figures posted?? this is what I think should be done. But some users have specified the OA vendor in the PO? Is this wrong now b/c OA vendor is not linked to the payee vendor... or in PO we should only specify the final payee vendor. your advise is appreciated... thanks.",

In your experience which of the integration option is better suited from a successfactors view point- Files or webservices(Using SF API)? SAP provides standard integration content for both file based integration as well as SFAPI based integration. However on the successfactors side are there any huge limitations and/or advantages of one over the other? PS: I'm aware of the technical dependencies and the limitations that come with both these options. Also we use SAP PI as our middleware, so personally my preference is to use webservices/SF API for this scenario, however I would like evaluate options from a functional person's/successfactors viewpoint.

As far as i remember php is flexible (instead of other programming languages) and with your syntax returns you the element 0 of the array. So, you have to use a loop (while statement) and at the beggining of each loop you have to \"declare\" wich line are you going to read/write with the SetCurrentLine method. A sample of this command in c# is... oOrder.Lines.SetCurrentLine(iDocRow); Good luck!!! Evanggelos D. Plagianos"
