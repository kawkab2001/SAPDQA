If SAP is the inventory system I would assume the user also need to perform the GR as a 501 movement type (goods receipt without order).

The cost element category is V - Sales and the control indicator actual revenues box to be unticked. The posting will be statistical for revenue elements. 2. The revenue recognition has to be equally done in VKOA for the account assignment of this account. 3. You can create a seperate order type for scrap sales and a sales pricing procedure in SD. 4. Check whether the scraps are defined to capture Tax Collected at Source, if so, you have to define condition types for them too. 5. If the material itself is defined as scrap material then in Material master the Profit Center would have been assigned and to capture the revenue assign the scrap sales revenue in VKOA.

Example: G/L account 4711 1.000 USD posted in June on cost centre. G/L account 4711 -1.000 USD posted in July on cost centre. Result: It is balanced out (zero). When looking at the field status group of the account only the cost centre is open. The SD-order is not open and not visible during manual posting. The account is thus not assigned to any line-ID in CO-PA which is o.K. However, the Interface made a mistake and posted also - in the Background - to an SD-order item. This can be seen in table BSEG for the FI documents in question. Effect: The account 4711 blocks KKA3 (the results Analysis) because it is not assigned to any line ID. ...and we do not want to assign it. Does anyone know about a trick on how to do KKA3 (and the settlement thereafter) nevertheless? Thanks a lot for any Input. Thomas",

So any cost center report reporting \"actual\" figures either does not report the statistical posting in june/july or mixes different value types (real/statistical) => no comment. The only \"trick\" that comes in my mind is a temporary line ID assigment in the debug mode but I definitely do not suggest to make it that way. A temporary customizing change for this particular case is the more accurate way, not to forget the correction of the interface. BR Christian"
