I need to know where that item in that production order originated from Generally, to get information about production orders we use transaction COOIS, which is the most complete report on shop floor control. Here you find information about production orders, operations, components, confirmations, components... basically everything related to production orders. Another useful transaction is MB56. Here, you can find all the history of an specific batch. Which order generated this batch, which components were consumed, etc... If you need to track the batched within an specific order, there is a functionality called WIP batches.

What's the value of the delayed order? My thought is to use something like vl06o to get a outbound delivery documents list with planned movement date and actual movement date. Then use excel to filter out those delayed documents numbers. Next, i'll use va05n to list order details such as order value. Still trying. I'll be really appreciated if someone could throw some light. Edited by: wenyuan dong on Nov 14, 2011 1:36 AM",

In the current version these fields are not filled. How can you determine the current price of a FIFO-related item? Valuation Price = (sum of single FIFO prices of the items in stock) : (inventory) A similar problem occurs with charge-off. So far, the total booking price was stored in ige1.stocksum, but in SAP8.8 it is not. For a recalculation we need the value actually posted at the item level. This is the reason why the price cannot be determined from the posting journal jdt1, because there, a sum of all entries calculated. Is there a reliable way, which works with both SAP2007 and SAP8.8? regards M.Heigl",

To get out the correct average inventory value, the following SQL statement would be correct: At charge off, the total value is determined via In this test, I have also found an error: If the single price (oinm.calcprice) = 0, for example because it was posted with a large factor, the item cannot be issued anymore. Error message \"acquisition price\" is missing (...) Error message \"acquisition price\" is missing (...) Tested with 2007ASP1PL9 and SAP 8.8 (8.80.230) SP0PL12 I assume that for FIFO evaluation SAP uses the calcprice and not the total price, the single price is determined, which in this case is 0 because of rounding.

If it is Blank than system will not ask for Planning time fence but if some value is there i.e 0,1,2,3,4 than system will ask fo rplanning time fence. Now for your second query 0 Procurement proposals are not firmed automatically. No firming takes place with this firming type. 1 Procurement proposals within the planning time fence are firmed automatically as soon as their date is at least one day before the end date of the planning time fence. The date of new procurement proposals created in the planning time fence is moved to the end date of the planning time fence.

This is feasible ony for uploading and for this you need to give path of the original files which are saved on some system.

For now this program frequency is on the first of every month. We did run program on 1stOctober 2019 and 1stNovember 2019 respectively. Seems, still independent requirement (VSF) shows in 03 September 2019. Could you please let us know the exact reason for this situation? Why system did not erase past PIR (VSF)? Regards, RR",

However for any old PIRs you want just to change them and not to delete then you can go for : MD74 If you want to delete old PIR then obvious you need to go with : MD75"
