The company object is a copy of the business tier of SAP Business One (that\u00b4s why it is a fat client application). And it needs to connect to the database.

I'm used to using a photoshop style layer system where things exist on top of one another. Occasionally I have the need for a field to overlay on top of a another but it needs to overlay. Typically i do use the transparent background or the turn on turn off method of having fields disappear while others appear, but I'm wondering if there is some sort of predictable way to make sometthing appear over something else. I have tried making the unique ID higher and lower than the conflicting field. I've tried cutting and pasting it over. Even simply turning the field invisible and visible again occasionally will make it overlay the whole line. Maybe there is no way to effectively move something to the top (front) of the page, but if anyone knows the logic that would be helpful moving into the future. Thanks! M",

Since you have used to those convenient ways to handle layers, it will be difficult for you to used to the PLD's limited ability. If you have too many overlaps, you probably need to restrict the numbers of overlap first. If that is not viable, you have to carefully plan first to reduce the troubles in bring one particular field on top. Thanks, Gordon"
