If that is the case then: Take the equipment number, then look in table EQUI for the Objekt number for this equipment, table EQUI with key EQUNR (the field EQUI-OBJNR) . With the objekt number look at table JEST. This table contains a relationship of an objekt and its Customer Status asigned to it, this table tells you also which status are active. Once you have the active status you can check table TJ02T to get the description of the status. JEST-STAT = TJ02T-ISTAT Hope this helps Carlos"

System requested for maintaining a Cost Element for Down payment expense. I checked several discussions and responses, all talked about what is the solution i.e. maintain the cost element as its just for information. Also, some referred to a SAP note which tells about a code change needed to switch off the behavior. However, my question is around: a) What if I maintain the cost element, I assume this item will appear in the line item report for my order in CO and will be used in periodic settlement? c) Also, what do if I do not want the item to appear as expense for my order and need not be settled? Is code change the only option? b) Why would SAP default such a config rather than providing an option available for configuration? Thanks, Ankur Goel",

                            "question": "Hi Gurus, We have a SAP LSO implementation. I need to develop a report to find the lead time between the time the participant pre-booked the course to the time he actually took the course. When a participant pre-books the course a relationship A/B 027 is created between D ( course type ) and P ( Person). The moment I include him in a course (E) under D this relationship vanishes from HRP1001 table. After this point I only have relationship A/B 025 between the objects course (E) and person (P). Is there a way by which I can distinguish if this employee had pre-booked? Many thanks in advance. Ajay",
