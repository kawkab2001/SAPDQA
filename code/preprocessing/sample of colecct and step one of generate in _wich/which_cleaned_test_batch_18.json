If you want to visualize these valid values you could use B1 DB Browser that gives you a complete view of your DB: tables, columns, links, valid values and so on. Note that not all these information are managed by native SQL but can be managed by the B1 application itself. For instance: links between tables are not implemented as foreign keys but managed by the application. This tool is available in either B1DE or B1TE packages. You can download these packages from SDN: go to the B1 SDN home page and navigate into Business One SDK Tools."

However as per GST Act, GST is to be paid on fair market value. For example, we are charging Rs. 100 from employees but fair market value is Rs. 1000. Hence we have to charge GST on Rs. 1000 but we still have to recover from employee only Rs. 500. In standard FI invoice through t code FB70, GST is charged only on the amount which is credited to income GL with tax code. Hence we are crediting Rs. 100/- to income GL with tax code and accordingly GST is charged on Rs. 100/- instead of Rs. 1000. I tried to handle the situation by usting stastical GL by posting following entry through t code FB70: Customer for Guesthouse 100.00 CGST - Payable 90.00- SGST - Payable 90.00- Discount 80.00 no tax code Stat A/C--INC 1,000.00- with Tax code Stat A/C--INC 1,000.00- no tax code This has solved my problem except for generating E invoice through t code edoc_cockpit where taxable value is picked up as Rs. 2080/- instead of Rs. 1000/- Hence please guide how to proceed with the situation - thanks in advance.",
