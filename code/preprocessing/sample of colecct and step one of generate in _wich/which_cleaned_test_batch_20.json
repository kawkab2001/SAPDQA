The second one keeps record of last payment from customers (this table is filled before applying payments and it consists in only two fields: ClientID and Amount. I will upload incoming payments through DTW, but since I only have the amount of the payment and not the invoices to where this money will be posted; I come to you for advice. For instance, my Customer1 just pay 5,000USD and has following invoices (in order of DueDate): - InvoiceA: 1,000 - InvoiceB: 700 - InvoiceF: 3,000 - InvoiceD: 5,000 - InvoiceC: 10,000 I need to create a query that gaves me wich Invoice (with the higher due date) can be cover with the amount given, and if cannot be covered completely, to apply the remaining balance of the Deposit and keep the invoice open as partial paid. The expected result from this would be: - Invoice A: 1,000 PAYED. Remaining balance of payment 4,000USD. - Invoice B: 700 PAYED. Remaining balance of payment 3,300USD (4000-700) - InvoiceF: 3,000 PAYED. Remaining balance of payment 300USD (3300-3000) - InvoiceD: 300 PARTIALLY PAYED. Remaining balance of payment 0USD (300-300) Thanks a lot, Israel.",

A code which is not yet connected with the field U_Code. The question is also: Can you use a FMS in a UDF in which you can select from a UDT. For example: UDT Code Name 01 01 02 02 03 03 I selected code 01 for an article. For another article I like to select a code which is not 01, but any other available code. So now I need a FMS in the UDF U_Code which shows me all the codes which are available (these should be 02 en 03) and select one of these two. Any other solutions will be helpfull as well. Probably I have to create two UDF. In one I can search for the available codes. In the other I can manually enter the code which I want. I would prefer the first solution. Thanks, Tim",

We can re-run the print program for that vendor to resend the mails. But, is there is any other way for users to send the e-mails struck in SOST?

This triggers a dependency where in turn a function is called to obtain/calculate,...a set of values which are then stored as part of the material master's classification data. This is all working fine for single value characteristics, but we also have a few multi-value characteristics. Let's say for example one the characteristics is the multi-value list of colors. Inside the match object of the function we would for example see two records: VARNAM ATFOR ATWRT COLOR CHAR RedCOLOR CHAR Blue In the CU02 dependency we have something like:FUNCTION ZGET_CHARS(......,COLOR = $SELF.COLOR,......) The logic is working fine for single-value characteristics, but not for multi-value characteristics.No errors or dump, but as soon as we return more than one value for a multi-value characteristic, all characteristics that were supposed to be populated are blanked out. Is there a way to make this work for multi-value characteristics? It's key that we can keep the multi-value char on the material master, so we do not want to split it up into COLOR1, COLOR2,.... I no clean solution is found we can set it during saving via the CLFM UE, but then the user doesn't see the result while initially maintaining the product and she would need to enter the material again after saving to see the results. It's an option, but hope there are better ones\ud83d\ude42Thanks in advance,Erik \ud83d\ude42",
