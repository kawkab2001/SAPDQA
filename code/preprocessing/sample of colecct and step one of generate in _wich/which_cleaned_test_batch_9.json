(Also bear in mind that POs, when created, are legal documents, so it would make sense to create 2018's in 2018) For 2019 however, it is not advised to do so in this way (your current period is 2017, next one is 2018, 2019 does not exist yet in the system) You cannot create multiple future periods - please review KBA 2499153.

Can Java stack be used for SAP Recipe development? If we use Java, wouldnt it be on a separate system? My understanding is that we cannot have Java and ABAP stack on same system and since Recipe Development is dependent on EH&S, it probably will use ABAP stack since both EH&S and Recipe Development exist in the same system.

The sender cost elements are grouped into a single assessment cost element or alternatively into several assessment cost elements via an allocation structure before being allocated to CO-PA. You enter the assessment cost element or the allocation structure in the segment header. You enter the sender cost elements to be grouped under allocation characteristics. The sender value can be calculated using various rules. You also enter the rule you want to use in the segment header. You must also enter a percentage for the sender value (with which the sender value is to be credited). The following are possible sender rules: Posted amounts (rule 1) Fixed portions (rule 2) Fixed prices (rule 3) If you use rule 2 or 3, you have to enter the fixed portions or prices for the individual senders in the sender values frame. Receiver The receiver is defined in assessment by: The profitability segment (which market segment is being allocated to / what generated the costs? The value field (which is being allocated to) Tracing factor (according to which distribution to the receivers occurs) The profitability segment for the receiver is defined by a combination of characteristic values. You enter the characteristic values in the Allocation characteristics frame. You can use a characteristic group to restrict the amount of characteristics offered at this point. Furthermore, to assign the respective characteristic group to the business transaction for indirect activity allocation to CO-PA, choose Actual Flows of Values \u00ae Transfer Overhead \u00ae Initial Steps \u00ae Assign Characteristic Groups to Actual Cycles in Customizing. For the allocation of planning data, choose Planning \u00ae Integrated Planning \u00ae Transfer Cost Center Planning/Process Planning \u00ae Initial Steps \u00ae Assign Characteristic Groups to Plan Cycles. In the segment header, you specify the value field (or value fields for fixed and variable portions, depending on the sender selected in the cycle header) into which the sender cost elements are to be entered. Alternatively, you can enter a PA transfer structure with which several value fields can be found for each sender cost element. The tracing factor for allocating to the receivers can be selected using various rules: Variable portions (rule 1) Fixed amounts (rule 2) Fixed percentage rates (rule 3) Fixed portions (rule 4) If you use rule 1, you need to enter an allocation base for calculating the variable portions. The allocation base can be either a value field or a key figure and it is obtained by adding and subtracting value fields in CO-PA Customizing (by choosing Flows of Actual Values \u00ae Transfer of Overhead \u00ae Initial Steps \u00ae Define Calculated Values for Use as Reference Values). Using rule 1 can sometimes result in a negative tracing factor. You therefore need to specify what scaling should be used in such instances. With receiver rule 1, you make the other entries for the tracing factor in the segment header frame. You can change and specify your entries in the tracing factors frame. The variable portion that is produced by the tracing factor can be manipulated again manually by choosing Receiver weighting. You can enter receiver-specific weighting factors, which are multiplied by the portion the system has calculated. Hence the portion calculated automatically and the receiver weighting factor you enter are both involved in the allocation. Reg *assign points if useful"
