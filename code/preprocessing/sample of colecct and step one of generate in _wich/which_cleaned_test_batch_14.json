But the present scope in hand is for ECC WM and we will upgrade to EWM in 1-2 yrs. My understanding is ITS mobile is the better option for SAP WM/EWM instead of Mobisys. However, if anyone has the experience, knowledge of comparison on these two technologies, or any other better-suited option, that will be highly appreciated. 2.

Via Portal also they can do this that is also good option. One thing i have to say is they can also use portal and ess both at the same time. Mean let them create portal and provide all these funcionalities there and use ESS as link and give them what ever SAP Standard ESS provides i.e salary slips showing,leave application and approval via workflow, display or change personnel data, family data,etc. Hope you got your answer atleast some idea if not full.
