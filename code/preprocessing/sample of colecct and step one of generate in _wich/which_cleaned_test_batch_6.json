As per client business requirement, in MM module they create the 7 plants as logistic plants. So automatically 7 maintenance planning plants or maintenance plants are created when plant is created. In this industry basically three different units, 1. Spinning, (for this unit Spinning maintenance department is separate) 2. Fabric Preparation (Weaving Unit) for this Weaving Maintenance Department separate and 3. is Processing unit. for these three units three Production maintenance teams are separate and One Electrical department for these three units and One Common Utilities team for these three units. Electrical & Utilities maintenance planning is done at central wise and rest of production maintenance is done at individual plant wise. Client asking the Department Vs Plant specific costing report. My Electrical operation & Utilities operations are common for all the three units, how i can assign these electrical and mechanical planner groups? If i made one planning plant, then it is very good for electrical and mechanical but its not suitable for Rest of three units. If i made individual planning plant how i can assign the electrical & utilities planning group. So i am requesting you please suggest the good method to define the PM organization structure. If i made the one planning plant then my entire MIS reporting structure is depends on planning plant and planner group and every time i need to select the maintenance plant and some other reporting fields. thanks in advance to all the PM experts.",

But our customers are in US and needs everything in Pounds (LB). I am SD guy and not much into materials, but I did some leg work and know that it has something to be with base unit of measure, alternative unit in additional tab. But my confusion is as following: we have base unit of measure as - EA (in basic data tab) and Wt. unit as G in dimensions. note: we also sometime use alternative unit as I box = 10 EA, and 1 Case = 200 Ea which is maintained in additional tab. Now what we want is ., if we create a sales order for 1 quantity, or 1 box, or 1 case then the Wt. should be in LB. But when we purchase material from Asia, we want to get it in grams and maintained in grms in stock with us. But our all Wm reporting and outgoing deliveries(856) invoice(8100 shld have LB. My try: My try: base unit of measure: EA wt. unit: G Sales unit: LB Order unit: G additional data tab conversions : 1 EA each <=> 1 EA 35.380 G g <=> 1 EA 77.930 LB US pound <=> 1 EA 1 PAC Pack <=> 10 EA 1 CV Case <=> 200 EA But still in the order I am getting G.
